# T3-Machine-Learning

Welcome to the repository for Problem Set 3 of the **Big Data and Machine Learning** course. This repository contains all the necessary materials, including code, data, and the final article, for the problem set.

## Repository Structure

- **`document/`**: Contains the final PDF article summarizing the analysis and results. An Overleaf link (view-only) is also provided for those interested in the LaTeX source.
- **`scripts/`**: Includes the Jupyter Notebook titled `Implementation.ipynb`, where all the code for data processing, feature engineering, and model implementation is located. To execute the script, ensure that all the files from the `stores/` folder are in the same directory.
- **`stores/`**: Stores all the datasets required for running the code and reproducing the results. This includes raw data and processed files referenced in the article.
- **`views/`**: Contains all the figures and tables used in the PDF article. These files can also be reused or adapted for presentations or further analyses.

## Project Summary

This project uses price and attribute information from **39,644 properties** in Bogot√°, Colombia, to train and evaluate five machine learning models. The goal is to predict property prices for **10,286 locations** in the Chapinero locality.

### Key Features
- **Data**: Information about prices, locations, and property attributes was used.
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom features were created to account for geographical and structural factors.
- **Models**: Five different machine learning models were trained and compared for their predictive performance.

### Visualization
Below is an example of one of the visualizations generated during the analysis:
